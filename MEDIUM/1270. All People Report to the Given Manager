Table: Employees

+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| employee_id   | int     |
| employee_name | varchar |
| manager_id    | int     |
+---------------+---------+
employee_id is the primary key for this table.
Each row of this table indicates that the employee with ID employee_id and name employee_name reports his work to his/her direct manager with manager_id
The head of the company is the employee with employee_id = 1.
 

Write an SQL query to find employee_id of all employees that directly or indirectly report their work to the head of the company.

The indirect relation between managers will not exceed 3 managers as the company is small.

Return result table in any order without duplicates.

FROM employees E
LEFT JOIN employees M ON E.manager_id = M.employee_id
LEFT JOIN EMPLOYEES B ON M.manager_id = B.employee_id
WHERE B.MANAGER_ID = 1 and e.employee_id <>1
